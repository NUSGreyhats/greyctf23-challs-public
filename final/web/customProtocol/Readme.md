# Custom Protocol

### Challenge Details

I have made a custom protocol inspired by rome.
I'm sure no one can crack it.


### Key Concepts
- Pattern recognition

### Solution
- Recognize that the text seems to be quite similar to english
- Can be decrypted using Caesar Cipher
- Find the pattern with Caesar Cipher
- Use the read command to read `./main.go` (`nawz ./cqyd.we`)
- Read the source code to find the flag code (`tvi3-sy4t-c1f test`)

### Hints
1. Source code is located at `main.go`

### Learning Objectives

### Flag
